    Abul Kalam Ghulam Muhiyuddin Ahmed bin Khairuddin Al-Hussaini Azad ((listen (help·info)); 11 November 
    1888 – 22 February 1958) was an Indian independence activist, Islamic theologian, writer and a senior leader
     of the Indian National Congress. Following India's independence, he became the First Minister of Education in
      the Indian government. He is commonly remembered as Maulana Azad; the word Maulana is an honorific meaning 
      'Our Master' and he had adopted Azad (Free) as his pen name. His contribution to establishing the education 
      foundation in India is recognised by celebrating his birthday as National Education Day across India.[2][3]

    As a young man, Azad composed poetry in Urdu, as well as treatises on religion and philosophy. He rose to 
    prominence through his work as a journalist, publishing works critical of the British Raj and espousing the 
    causes of Indian nationalism. Azad became the leader of the Khilafat Movement, during which he came into close
     contact with the Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi. After the failure of the Khilafat Movement, he became closer to
      the Congress.[4] Azad became an enthusiastic supporter of Gandhi's ideas of non-violent civil disobedience,
       and worked to organise the non-co-operation movement in protest of the 1919 Rowlatt Acts. Azad committed
        himself to Gandhi's ideals, including promoting Swadeshi (indigenous) products and the cause of Swaraj
         (Self-rule) for India. In 1923, at an age of 35, he became the youngest person to serve as the President
          of the Indian National Congress.
    
    In October 1920, Azad was elected as a member of foundation committee to establish Jamia Millia Islamia
     at Aligarh in U. P. without taking help from British colonial government. He assisted in shifting the 
     campus of the university from Aligarh to New Delhi in 1934. The main gate (Gate No. 7) to the main campus 
     of the university is named after him.
